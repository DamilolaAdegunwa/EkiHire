It also provides a marketplace for consumers to purchase goods, avail of services and research employment opportunities locally, nationally and internationally. 
The App is free for consumers to use, while advertisers are charged a monthly subscription fee, after a one month free trial period, for the registration of a business page. 
Advertiser are again charged a percentage of the sales fee for each item sold.

# Features & Tech Stack for the EkiHire App Development

For starters, building a native app is the recommended approach to us in  app development. This allows for the creation of a custom app for each operating system and ensures better performance, speed, security and the ability to get access to the built-in smart phone capabilities like geo-location and maps. 

#The core features involved in HireEki App development are as follows:
#Customer Features
User login and registration.
User profile
Search
Ordering
Google map integration
In-app payment processing
Push notifications
Messaging
Service/goods  rating review
Transaction history
Customer support including an SOS button and lot more...


#Admin Panel Functionality

Secure login access

Location and fare management

Check ratings and reviews

Notification management

System content management and frequently asked questions (FAQ)

Customers / user support

Integration with Google Analytics

Wallet Creation


#Stages & Costs for the HireEki App Development

Before we proceed with the HireEki app development cost, it is very much necessary to make you fully understand how the app software is actually created from clickable prototype to production (market-ready product).

#Essentially, the entire process is divided into a few phases, namely:

Pre-development Stage (also known as the discovery or research phase) – 4 weeks

Business analysis

UI/UX design

Software architecture planning

Project management

Team review

Functional prototype

Development Stage (includes testing and deployment processes) – 22 to 25  weeks

Early planning

Development (App version for Android and iOS)

Quality assurance and testing

Project management

Team review

#Please Note:

The discovery stage starts with planning in order to complete the project successfully. It is at this stage that the client or business owner/analyst (you) and a software architect (from us) would meet and properly align the business requirements with the technical implementation so as to create a product backlog. The product backlog would serve as a list of all the features the HireEki app would need. Then, the UI designer creates/designs the interface and user experience of the application based on the required features in the product backlog.


#What can be achieved at the discovery stage are as follows:

Finalized app concept

Product backlog

Project architecture plan

Product design (UI/UX, clickable prototype)

#In Conclusion

For a fully featured and functional HireEki app to be successfully developed and properly maintained, it requires a significant large amount of investment both monetarily and time-wise. So, having considered all this, if the cost of development above befits your budget then, we can proceed with a mutual agreement as the development of the mobile application proceeds accordingly after an initial 50% deposit of the development cost above has been made. The remaining 50% would be made as soon as we reach the last stage of development (deployment).
